# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System GUI

A modern AI-powered desktop application that analyzes soil and climate conditions to recommend the most suitable crops.  
The system combines machine learning with a local Large Language Model (LLM) to provide both accurate crop predictions and human-readable explanations.

---

# ✨ Features

- **🧠 AI Crop Prediction**
  Uses a trained XGBoost classifier to recommend crops based on:
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Phosphorus (P)
  - Potassium (K)
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - pH
  - Rainfall

- **🤖 Local LLM Explanations**
  Supports local GGUF models through `llama.cpp` to explain predictions in natural language.

- **💬 Interactive Chat**
  Ask follow-up questions about:
  - Recommended crops
  - Soil conditions
  - Farming tips
  - Environmental suitability

- **🎨 Modern Desktop UI**
  Built with `customtkinter` using a clean dark-themed interface.

- **⚡ Fallback Explanation System**
  If the LLM is unavailable, the app automatically switches to a built-in rule-based explanation engine.

# 🚀 Installation

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CRS_V2.git
cd CRS_V2
```

---

## 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### Activate Environment

#### Linux/macOS

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
python install.py
```

> **Note:**  
> If `llama-cpp-python` fails to install because of missing C++ build tools, the application will still work using the fallback explanation system.
